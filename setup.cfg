# W503 enforces the break after the operator, which is acceptable, but it's
# preferred to do it before the operator. Since YAPF enforces the preferred
# style, this rule is ignored.
# D107 enforces writing docstrings for `__init__`, but this is usually duplicative of the class docstring.
# Sphinx supports interpreting the arguments from the class docstring as the arguments for `__init__`.
# We choose that as our convention and disable this rule.
